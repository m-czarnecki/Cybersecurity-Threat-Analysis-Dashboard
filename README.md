# Global-Cybersecurity-Threats-Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard Creation using MS Excel)

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze global cybersecurity threats from 2015 to 2024 by building a dynamic, interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel.  
This dashboard helps visualize critical trends in cyberattacks, identify the industries and countries most impacted, and assess the effectiveness of different defense mechanisms against various attack sources.  
The project simulates a real-world business intelligence scenario and showcases my ability to deliver high-quality, actionable visualizations for decision-making support.

## Dataset Used
- <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/global-cybersecurity-threats-2015-2024>**Global Cybersecurity Threats Dataset (2015–2024)** sourced from Kaggle</a>
- Covers over 3000+ cybersecurity incidents across countries, industries, and attack types.

## Questions (KPIs)
- What are the trends in cyberattack types over the years 2015–2024? 
- Which industries suffered the highest financial losses due to cyberattacks? 
- Which countries reported the most cyberattacks over time? 
- How effective are different defense mechanisms based on the average incident resolution time? 
- Which attack types resulted in the highest financial losses between 2015 and 2024? 
- Which industries reported the highest number of users affected by cyberattacks between 2015 and 2024? 
- How effective are different defense mechanisms in reducing average incident resolution time against various attack sources? 
- How do financial losses from cyberattacks vary across industries and attack sources between 2015 and 2024?

## Process
- Cleaned and verified the data for missing values, data type inconsistencies, and anomalies.
- Created multiple advanced PivotTables to break down financial loss, number of affected users, and attack frequency.
- Developed dynamic PivotCharts including Clustered Bar Charts, 100% Stacked Bars, Radar Chart and Heat Map.
- Merged all visualizations into a single, well-organized Excel dashboard.
- Applied slicers to enable interactive filtering (by year, attack type, etc.).
- Exported the dashboard as a clean, professional PDF ready for presentation.

The dashboard layout ensures easy readability and modern visuals.

## Project Insights
- **DDoS attacks** caused the highest financial losses across several industries.
- **IT and Banking industries** reported the highest financial losses between 2015–2024.
- **Firewalls** mechanisms had the fastest average resolution times across all attack sources.
- **UK, Brasil and India** were among the most targeted countries over the analysis period.
- **IT and Banking** industries reported the highest number of users affected by cyberattacks between 2015 and 2024.

## Final Conclusion
The analysis of global cybersecurity threats between 2015 and 2024 highlights critical trends across industries, countries, and attack types. The number of cyberattacks has remained consistently high throughout the decade, with notable peaks around 2017 and 2022.
Financial losses are heavily concentrated in sectors like IT and Banking, indicating these industries are primary targets for high-impact cyber threats. Attack types such as DDoS, Phishing, and SQL Injection have caused the most financial damage. 
When analyzing by geography, countries like UK, Brasil and India have reported the highest number of cyberattacks. Interestingly, Firewalls show the fastest incident resolution time.
The dashboard visualization allows for an intuitive exploration of these trends, offering valuable insights for organizations aiming to strengthen their cybersecurity posture in a constantly evolving threat landscape.
